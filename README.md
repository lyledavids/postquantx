Private post-quantum txs on ethereum using zk-SNARKS and ZoKrates

This project implements privacy-preserving Ethereum transactions resistant to quantum attacks using zk-STARKs (zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge) and ZoKrates. By replacing traditional zk-SNARKs with quantum-safe zk-STARKs, the system ensures transaction anonymity while guarding against future quantum decryption. Users can deposit, transfer, and withdraw ETH privately through a Solidity smart contract that verifies proofs generated by ZoKrates circuits.
